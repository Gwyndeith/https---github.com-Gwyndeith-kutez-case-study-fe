## Development server
After making sure you have the required Angular and NodeJS version installed on your local. Using VS Code (VS Code was used during the development), clone the repository to your local, run the "npm install" script in a command prompt and wait for the installation to finish.
Running the command "npm run serve" will run a local server for the project and open a new tab on your browser automatically, the local server runs on port 4200.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files and save.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
